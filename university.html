		<h3>Death Grips Fansite (2017)</h3>
		<p>This site was created for an assignment in which I was tasked with designing a website for a music artist. I chose death grips because their aesthetic was fun to work with. The site features links to their music videos, their 2 free albums and a shirt customisation tool. The website utilises html, css and javascript.</p>

		<h3>Assassin's Code (2019)</h3>
		<p>This game was created as part of my Group Project for University along with Harry Weston, Elliott McDonald, Elliott Stokes, Sam Trivett and Owen Illingworth. The aim was to make a game that teaches programming, and on a basic level it does this. You can input commands that are translated into C# on the left hand side, and clicking run will execute the code in one go.</p>

		<h3>TFL VR Underground Simulator (2020)</h3>
		<p>This Virtual Reality project was developed for my dissertation in 3rd year, and was based on a real TFL underground train. However, when I met with TFL it was agreed that the simulator would only be allowed for use in the dissertation, so I cannot share the files. I did record myself demonstrating it as part of my assessment though, which is linked below.</p>

		<p>Hello and welcome to my Portfolio! This is a collection of my best work over the years, and I will continuously add to this page as I learn more about game design and writing code.</p>
		<h3>Terminal Velocity (2017)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/terminalVelocity.png" alt = "Screenshot of Terminal Velocity Gameplay">
		<p>Terminal Velocity was my end of year project for A-level Computer Science. It lacks many features but was predicted nearly full marks (despite getting a D in the end). It was around the point I made this game that I became serious about making my own games.</p>

		<h3>Spheres (2017)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/spheres.png" alt = "Screenshot of Spheres Gameplay">
		<p>Spheres was the game I produced at my first game jam, during which I slept for around 10 hours due to poor planning. I did however win a prize for at least making a functional game in a one man team.</p>

		<h3>1983 (2018)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/1983.png" alt = "Screenshot of 1983 Gameplay">
		<p>This was my first game I made as part of a team for Global Game Jam 2018, and while we never finished it we got a fair demonstration of our idea across. Hit 'P' to skip to the last 5 seconds. I play kazoo in the soundtrack, as it was a modifier to provide a custom soundtrack and I had a kazoo. I know it's terrible. Sorry.</p>

		<h3>Time Game Ting (2018)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/timeGameTing.png" alt = "Screenshot of Time Game Ting Gameplay">
		<p>Time Game Ting is probably the best game I'd made up to that point, utilising the skills I'd learned over the past years. This was made in 24 hours with a handful of modifiers including 'Elon Musk' and 'Time'.</p>

		<h3>HallowEaster (2018)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/hallowEaster.png" alt = "Screenshot of HallowEaster Gameplay">
		<p>HallowEaster was one of my first attempts at making a 2D game in Unity. I know it's not great but I learned a fair bit about animation and 2D physics while I made this. Also it nearly won a prize for use of the 'horrible SFX' modifier at the game jam it was made for, with a soundtrack comprised entirely from stock scream effects.</p>

		<h3>Home Run (2019)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/homeRun.png" alt = "Screenshot of Home Run Gameplay">
		<p>For Global Game Jam 2019 I worked on a solo project in Unity 3D, with the key theme of 'What Home Means to You'. As usual sleep deprivation played a large role in this game's development, and I made something truly stupid. This is one of the more story-driven games I've made and gameplay is fairly rudimentary, but it works well enough.</p>

		<h3>Assassin's Code (2019)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/assassinsCode.png" alt = "Screenshot of Assassin's Code Gameplay">
		<p>This game was created as part of my Group Project for University along with Harry Weston, Elliott McDonald, Elliott Stokes, Sam Trivett and Owen Illingworth. The aim was to make a game that teaches programming, and on a basic level it does this. You can input commands that are translated into C# on the left hand side, and clicking run will execute the code in one go.</p>

		<h3>LEGacy (2019)</h3>
		<img src = "Screenshots/legacy.png" alt = "Screenshot of LEGacy Gameplay">
		<p>This game is one of the more complicated that I've made. In essence it is a clicker game, where you gather marmalade to power the big ball of feet (football) as it rolls from Watford to Lincoln. Hit 'P' to skip to the ending, I honestly don't expect anyone to beat this.</p>
